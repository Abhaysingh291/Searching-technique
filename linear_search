Linear Search is defined as a sequential search algorithm that starts at one end and goes through each element of a list until the desired element is found, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data set. It is the easiest searching algorithm.
Given an array arr[] of N elements, the task is to write a function to search a given element x in arr[].

Examples:
Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 110;
Output: 6
Explanation: Element x is present at index 6

Input: arr[] = {10, 20, 80, 30, 60, 50,110, 100, 130, 170}, x = 175;
Output: -1
Explanation: Element x is not present in arr[].

// C code to linearly search x in arr[]. If x
// is present then return its location, otherwise
// return -1

CODE:
#include <stdio.h>

int search(int arr[], int N, int x)
{
	int i;
	for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
		if (arr[i] == x)
			return i;
	return -1;
}

// Driver's code
int main(void)
{
	int arr[] = { 2, 3, 4, 10, 40 };
	int x = 10;
	int N = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

	// Function call
	int result = search(arr, N, x);
	(result == -1)
		? printf("Element is not present in array")
		: printf("Element is present at index %d", result);
	return 0;
}
